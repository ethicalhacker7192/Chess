# Chess
a ascii chess game that can be played in terminal or in cmd. (in progress, feel free to help!)


# All help is welcome!

all creators welcome to help, currently on castling (king moves but rook does not)
need help with kingside and queenside castling, checking, turns, checkmate, stalemate, en passant capturing, etc.

all credit to those who help.

feel free to check for bugs!

to join this project, ask if you can in the issues section.

add features, however if they are not related to game rules, feel free to make your own branch and own versions, I would love to see many variations!
